# 🚗🤖 AutoParts Inc. AI Agent System

Welcome to the **AutoParts Inc. AI Agent Implementation** project! This repository contains the full assignment submission, including the case study analysis, workflow simulation, and supporting diagrams.

## 📌 Project Overview

AutoParts Inc. is a mid-sized automotive parts manufacturer facing challenges such as:

* ⚠️ 15% defect rate in precision components
* 🛠️ Unpredictable machine downtime
* 👷 Rising labor costs
* 📦 Increasing customer demands for customization

To address these challenges, we deploy a **multi-agent AI system** integrating predictive maintenance, automated quality assurance, and supply chain optimization.

## 🤖 AI Agents Implemented

### 1️⃣ Predictive Maintenance Agent

* Monitors machine sensor data
* Predicts failures before breakdowns
* Reduces downtime and maintenance costs

### 2️⃣ Quality Assurance Agent

* Uses computer vision to detect defects
* Reduces scrap and improves product quality

### 3️⃣ Supply Chain & Order Optimization Agent

* Optimizes production schedules
* Aligns inventory with customer demand
* Improves delivery speed and customization

## 🧩 n8n Workflow Simulation

The project includes an **n8n workflow simulation** showing how agents interact:

* Machine sensors → Predictive Maintenance
* Production schedule → Quality Assurance
* QA reports → Supply Chain Optimization

## 📈 Expected Benefits

### 💰 Quantitative

* Reduce defects from **15% → <5%**
* Lower machine downtime by **30%**
* Reduce labor cost overhead by **10–15%**

### 🌟 Qualitative

* Improved worker morale
* Faster customer delivery
* Better data-driven decisions
